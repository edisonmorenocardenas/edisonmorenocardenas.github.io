    <!-- Proyecto 1 -->
    <li>
      <strong>National University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco, Peru</strong><br>
      12/2025 - present: <em>Design and simulation of a PI controller applied to a permanent magnet synchronous motor</em>
      This project aims to design and simulate a PI controller for a permanent 
      magnet synchronous motor, improving stability and performance in speed or 
      position control. The system will be modelled and evaluated through simulation 
      in order to validate an efficient, low-cost control strategy for industrial and electric mobility applications.

    <!-- Proyecto 2 -->
    <li>
      <strong>Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain</strong><br>
      09/2022 - 07/2024: <em>Radio access network evolution towards 6G for massive and low latency services</em>
      This project has focused on addressing the limitations of current 5G networks to support 
      future Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. The aim is to define and develop new 
      generations of wireless networks (B5G and 6G) capable of seamlessly integrating IoE
      functionalities.

      <br>
      09/2019 - 09/2022: <em>Dynamic Network Slicing in 5G Radio Access (ATLAS)</em>
      This project has addressed the management of physical and virtual resource allocation 
      by the infrastructure provider to tenants, as well as the business models associated 
      with this provider-tenant relationship. This project has been funded by the European Union (EU) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.
